### 1. GNN Out-of-distibution(OOD) generalization

- Graph neural network (GNN) is a general framework for using deep neural networks on graph data. 
- But little work has been done on understanding under what conditions GNNs can be used as a core module for building general inference models. 
- To study this question, we consider the task of out of distribution generalization where training and test data have different distributions. 
- We hypothesize that the difference in underlying graph properties of training and test datasets presents one of the fundamental challenges to the extrapolation beyond the range of input distribution
